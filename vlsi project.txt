my project involves simulation which tests and improves
		the security of chips in electronic devices. 
		
the existing system considered only the physical attacks on SOC devices but 
		our proposed system performs various attacks simulations.

  also the project involves the attack generation and detection using the pattern of attacks.

This project isn't designed for use in a real organization or institution. 

Instead, it's a learning tool to help me understand ..
					how different programming concepts work together. 

By building this project, I've learned how to connect Java with a database using 
									JDBC and SQL. 

I've also practiced using object-oriented programming concepts.

This experience has given me a better understanding of how to build software that 
				manages data and interacts with databases.
